Application for booking room and boarding when you don't need a full apartment or house for rent. When you are looking for the minimum place to stay and sleep without the hassle of paying for full apartments or houses, we are here to solve your problem. Our application will connect the users with property owners that will host their available rooms for boarding. Property owners who have spare bedrooms who want to connect with people can come sign up to get with users who might need a room for boarding that are looking in the area.
